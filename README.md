## Raspberry Pi Pico Pulse Oximeter

Before getting started make sure you search for and install the following libraries on your Pico:
* micropython_max30102 (https://github.com/n-elia/MAX30102-MicroPython-driver/tree/main)
* micropython_ssd1306 (https://github.com/stlehmann/micropython-ssd1306)

As of right now the OLED only outputs BPM but both are visible in the console

Before getting started make sure you search for and install the following libraries on your Pico:
* micropython_max30102 (https://pypi.org/project/micropython-max30102/)
* micropython_ssd1306 (https://github.com/stlehmann/micropython-ssd1306)

I'm not sure if the screen works because mine broke halfway through the project, but the pulse rate and blood oxygen readings seem to be fairly accurate to my Coros Pace 3's readings
